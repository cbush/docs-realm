Sync
----

Sync fails to enable shortly after cluster creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may encounter strange behavior when enabling {+sync+} on a
newly-created cluster. This happens because an SRV record hasn't
propagated yet. While we work to resolve this issue, there are two
possible workarounds:

- Wait five minutes, then enable {+sync+}.
- Unlink and :ref:`re-link the cluster <link-a-cluster>`.
